# Meal Mate

**Meal Mate** is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes based on a specific ingredient. The application fetches and displays detailed information about each recipe, including the recipe name, an image, and preparation instructions. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Axios library for making API requests.

## Key Features:
- **Ingredient Search**: Users can input an ingredient to find recipes that include it.
- **Recipe Details**: For each recipe found, the application displays the name, image, and detailed instructions.
- **Responsive Design**: The application uses Bootstrap for styling, ensuring it looks good on various devices.

## Which API did you use? Why did you choose that one?
I selected the MealDB API because it offers practical value for daily life. As a college student, I frequently face the challenge of creating meals with the limited ingredients left in my fridge. The MealDB API's extensive recipe database is perfect for a recipe finder application, providing diverse and delicious meal options tailored to whatever ingredients are available.

## How did you interact with the API, technically?
I interacted with the API using the Axios library to make HTTP requests. Axios simplifies the process of making requests and handling responses in JavaScript. By using `axios.get()`, I was able to fetch data from the MealDB API endpoints and utilize the response data to dynamically generate content on the web page.

## What does your project do/how does it work?
Meal Mate allows users to input an ingredient and search for recipes that include it. Upon searching, the application fetches a list of recipes from the MealDB API. For each recipe, detailed information is retrieved, including the name, image, and preparation instructions. This information is then displayed on the web page, providing users with useful meal ideas based on the ingredients they have.

## If you were going to keep coding this project, what would you build next?
If I were to continue developing this project, I would focus on adding more styling to improve the visual appeal and user experience. Some potential enhancements include:

- **Improved Layout**: Using advanced CSS techniques and Bootstrap components to create a more visually appealing and responsive layout.
- **User Feedback**: Adding features to handle empty search results or invalid inputs.
- **Recipe Filtering**: Allowing users to filter recipes by additional criteria such as cuisine type, preparation time, and dietary restrictions.
- **Favorites Feature**: Implementing functionality for users to save their favorite recipes for easy access in the future.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring the application is fully optimized for mobile devices with a responsive design.
